# Lab 28 ~ Routing and Testing

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
The focus on this lab is on exploring modularization of React components, instead of working with one giant `main.js` file for the entirety of the application. As applications scale in size, one size does not fit all effectively. This requires an undertanding of how to properly pass `props` from parent to child components, and how to modify state of parents through their children in response to various events.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. If wanting to view tests, enter `npm install -D` into the command line. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions.
